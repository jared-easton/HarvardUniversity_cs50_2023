#### 2) Final Project Description:
#### <ins>**Situation:**</ins> I enrolled in the cs50 course from Harvard because I’d heard great things about the course and its cadre. I was excited to expand on my existing knowledge-base that had been accumulated through my years in the United States Air Force and corporate America. As I progressed through the course material I formed the assessment that “I concurred with everything I had heard about the corse before beginning… that regardless of what I knew coming it, cs50 was going to be a challenge.”

#### As I completed each Lecture's, Section's, Lab's, and Problem Set's… I began to share the sense of pride I was feeling by completing a course and gaining a certification from Harvard. As I shared my journey, it was met with an interesting response. To my amazement people actually poked fun at me and made jokes about the infamous “cs50 Duck Debugger”.

#### As I thought about the negative feedback I was receiving I grew upset by the idea that people, ones that have never taken a course from Harvard… nor ones that had ever taken a computer science course in general, would feel the right or sense of entitlement to make fun of a valuable tool (not to mention the mascot of the program) that has proven results in problem solving methodology.

#### <ins>**Task:**</ins> With this feedback now known to me, I knew I had to provide a valuable resource that would break the stigma of the “cs50 Duck Debugger” and restore the provinaunce to this profound and famed tool. Lucky for Harvard and the cs50 program I am located in Chicago, IL and have an understanding of its vast and unparalleled art history. I began conducting research at the Art Institute of Chicago by way of its open source API where I was able to locate a deep history and genealogy, tracing the lineage of the Harvard cs50 Duck Debugger back thousands of years.

#### <ins>**Action:**</ins> My cs50 “Final Project” is a simple Swift iOS application that uses data from the Art Institute of Chicago’s OpenAPI. The applications main feature os the showcasing of how the cs50 Duck Debugger’s ancestors have effected the course of history by being present and enabling the solving of humankind’s most complex problems.

#### <ins>**Result:**</ins> My cs50 Final Project, titled chicagoART ~for cs50~, addresses the societal misunderstandings of the cs50 Duck Debugger by highlighting global famed duck works of art housed in the world renowned galleries of the Art Institute of Chicago.
